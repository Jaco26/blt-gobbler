# BLT Gobbler ü•™üëÑ

A parser for BLT formatted text OpaVote election results.

[See it in action](https://jaco26.github.io/blt-gobbler/)!

Below is excerpted from https://www.opavote.com/help/overview#blt-file-format 

A ballot file contains the following information:
- The first line has two numbers indicating the number of candidates and the
  number of seats.
- The second line is the first ballot, and each following line is another 
  ballot until you reach the end of ballots marker. Each ballot is a separate
  line.
- The first number on a ballot line indicates a ballot weight, and for most 
  elections, this will always be 1. The last number on a ballot line is 
  always 0 to indicate the end of a ballot.
- The other numbers on a ballot line indicate the rankings. The second number 
  on a ballot line is the candidate number of the first ranked candidate, the 
  third number on a ballot line is the candidate number of the second ranked 
  candidate, and so forth.
- A ballot line of "1 0" is an empty ballot that did not rank any candidates. 
  If a ballot ranks 1 candidate, then the ballot line will have 3 numbers. If 
  a ballot ranks 4 candidates, then the ballot line will have 6 numbers.
- A line with only a 0 is an end of ballots marker and indicates that the 
  previous line was the last ballot.
- The lines after the end of ballots marker indicate the candidate names in 
  double quotes. The number of candidate names must match the number 
  indicated on the first line.
- The line after the candidate names is the title in double quotes.
- Blank lines, extra white space, and any comments (text after a #) are 
  ignored.
- Be careful with double quotes. They must be straight double quotes (") and 
  not curly double quotes (‚Äú‚Äù).
- If you have more than 10,000 ballots, then OpaVote stores the ballots in 
  what we call a "packed" format. Only unique ballots are included in the BLT 
  file and the weight indicates the number of times that the ballot occurred.

The BLT file format has some other features that may be useful for some 
users:
- You can indicate withdrawn candidates in the BLT file. To do this, insert 
  a line after the first line and before the first ballot. This line lists 
  negative candidate numbers to indicate that those candidates have 
  withdrawn. E.g., a second line of "-1 -3" indicates that candidates 1 and 
  3 have withdrawn.
- You can indicate undervotes (also known as skipped rankings) with a hyphen.
  E.g., a ballot line of "1 3 - 2 0" indicates that candidate 3 was ranked 
  first, no candidate was ranked second, and candidate 2 was ranked third. 
  Most counting methods will ignore the skipped ranking and go on to the next 
  ranking.
- You can indicate duplicate rankings (also known as overvotes) with an equal 
  sign. E.g., a ballot line of "1 3=2 1 0" indicates that both candidate 2 
  and candidate 3 were ranked first and that candidate 1 was ranked second. 
  Most counting methods will ignore the overvote and go on to the next 
  ranking.

An annotated example of a BLT file is shown below:
```bash
4 2          # Four candidates are competing for two seats
-2           # Bob has withdrawn
1 4 1 3 2 0  # First ballot
1 3 4 1 2 0  # Chuck first, Amy second, Diane third, Bob fourth
1 2 4 1 0    # Bob first, Amy second, Diane third
1 4 3 0      # Amy first, Chuck second
6 4 3 0      # Amy first, Chuck second with a weight of 6
1 0          # An empty ballot
1 2 - 3 0    # Bob first, no one second, Chuck third
1 2=3 1 0    # Bob and Chuck first, Diane second
1 2 3 4 1 0  # Last ballot
0            # End of ballots marker
"Diane"      # Candidate 1
"Bob"        # Candidate 2
"Chuck"      # Candidate 3
"Amy"        # Candidate 4
"Gardening Club Election"  # Title
